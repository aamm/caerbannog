##
## Counter example!! This shows a limitation in Caerbannog.
##
## You can only have a single level of environment switch in
## loops. In the example bellow, the nested blocks start with
## a Bash block, which has a Python block, which in turn try
## to run Bash code.
##
## Indentation is also a problem here.
##

import sys

# for i in $(seq 3); do #
    for i in xrange(10):
# echo "===> $<i>"
     print "a"
# done #
